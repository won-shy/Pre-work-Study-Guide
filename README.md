# Pre-work-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who are working through the Prework modules. This guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Though this was my first venture into coding fully, it was a great way to acclimate myself on topics and subjects that will be exhaustively explored throughout the bootcamp to come. Completing this project both helped me organize the prework information and visualize what I was learning into practice.
